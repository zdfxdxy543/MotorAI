# GMP Generator Engine - v2

## Overview
v2 is an isolated experiment area for controller design generation with LLM.
It is independent from the rest of the repository runtime logic.

Current v2 focus:
- Convert natural-language requirements into controller loop selection.
- Output selected control loops, stable loop IDs, and loop properties.
- Keep output minimal JSON for downstream steps.
- Support controller-loop styles such as position_error_loop, torque_reference_loop, speed_loop, and current_loop.

## Main Script
- controller_loop_id_exporter.py

What it does:
- Takes a natural-language requirement (Chinese or English).
- Calls the configured LLM endpoint from ../motorai_settings.json.
- Returns selected loops only, each with id, name, and properties.
- Canonicalizes loop IDs so the same loop name always maps to the same ID.

## Minimal Call
Run from the v2 directory:

```powershell
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe ./controller_loop_id_exporter.py "需要设计吸尘器电机控制器"
```

Optional short form with explicit output file:

```powershell
../.venv/Scripts/python.exe ./controller_loop_id_exporter.py "需要设计吸尘器电机控制器" --output ./controller_loop_ids_cn_test.json
```

## Minimal Output Example
```json
{
  "requirement": "Design a vacuum cleaner motor controller",
  "language": "en",
  "selected_loops": [
    {
      "id": "loop_current_001",
      "name": "current_loop",
      "properties": ["real_speed"]
    },
    {
      "id": "loop_speed_001",
      "name": "speed_loop",
      "properties": ["speed"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes
- This README documents only the v2 area.
- For successful calls, configure llm.api_key, llm.model, and llm.base_url in ../motorai_settings.json.
- The Generate and Optimize agents share only the LLM endpoint settings; each agent keeps its own prompts.
